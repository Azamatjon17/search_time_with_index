# SearchTimeWithIndexBase Package

The `search_time_with_index_base` package provides three search algorithms with timing functionalities for evaluating their performance: Binary Search, Linear Search, and Jump Search. This package is designed to help you measure the efficiency of these search algorithms in terms of execution time and index lookup.

## Features

- **Binary Search**: Efficiently search a sorted list using a divide-and-conquer approach.
- **Linear Search**: Sequentially search through a list, suitable for unsorted lists.
- **Jump Search**: A compromise between linear and binary search, effective on sorted lists.

## Installation

To use this package, add `search_time_with_index_base` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  search_time_with_index_base: ^1.0.0
